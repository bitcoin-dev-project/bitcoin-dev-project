                        are backed by core teams. Lightning protocol development
                        moves faster than the bitcoin protocol. Given that
                        lightning is still young, there are more rough edges to
                        smooth and problems to sort. The best way to get
                        involved is to jump on their slack or discord and start
                        picking up issues.
